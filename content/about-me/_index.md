I'm Gayathri Suresh. An engineer by profession and now childbirth educator by passion.
Iraivi is the result of my interest to assist pregnant couples in preparing for labor, delivery, and postpartum adjustment with confidence. Iraivi is here to assist with the transition, laying the groundwork for confident childbirth and parenthood. <!--more-->
Pregnancy is both an exciting and nerve-wracking experience. It's the same with postpartum. I'm here to support you to manage your dreams and worries about starting a family.
As an ICEA Certified Childbirth Educator (ICCE), I've had significant training in pregnancy, childbirth, and newborn care. There is nothing more humbling, primal, strong, or wonderful than childbirth in my opinion.  As a Lactation certified professional I will offer support, advice and guidance for solving issues in breastfeeding of a new mother.

I consider it an honor and a pleasure to work with you and I eagerly await the opportunity to get to know you. Let us embrace the birthing process and beyond as a family.

### We provide the following services to best accompany you on your journey

## MY CORE VALUES

- Compassion:
    I believe that treating maternity care with compassion and a loving attitude helps families have better birth outcomes.
- Collaboration:
    I feel that surrounding Mom with a circle of support, with her at the center, is critical to her developing confidence in delivery as a regular life occurrence. As a childbirth educator, I am a part of that vital circle of support.
- Choice:
    I feel that information is essential for couples to make sound decisions. My approach is built on the presentation of evidence-based research in order for couples to have the flexibility to make informed decisions.
