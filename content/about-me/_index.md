Hi, I’m Gayathri Suresh. Founder of Iraivi. I’m an internationally certified childbirth educator. An engineer turned childbirth educator. The journey of my pregnancy led me to this profession. <!--more-->The birth trauma & breastfeeding difficulties I had faced brought me to choose childbirth education as my profession. As an ICEA certified childbirth educator (ICCE), I include a variety of evidence based information & resources in my instruction.
Along with the exciting news of pregnancy there comes the fear of unknown.
I’d love to teach expectant mothers how to trust their body that was designed for birth! You will be more confident about birth after our classes. Pregnancy is a celebration by gaining right knowledge & guidance to begin your journey as a parent. Get educated & be empowered.
