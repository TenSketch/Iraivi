      Your sessions helped me alot. You have covered everything from giving birth to postpartum health especially diet plan. I felt more prepared. You told me to ask doubts anytime. I have followed all your breathing techniques, relaxation and visualization for handling pain and coping with contractions. My labour journey was stressless and I was more confident because of you. I'm happy to be part of your sessions."

      content : "Mrs. Gayathri Suresh is wife of my Friend Suresh, she is my good sister, when I was working at Qatar. But after my marriage I moved to Mumbai, and by 2020 March we came to know that we are gonna become Father and Mother for a cutie child. Globally March 2020 was hit by Covid19 1st wave, and we were getting trouble even to visit Doctors, and hospitals for our initial stage of pregnancy tests. India was affected toobad by Covid 19 1st wave. So, Mumbai got complete lockdown. No buses, trains, or even flights to return to our hometown. We were alone at Mumbai, at that moment our sister Ms Gayathri Suresh explained about Child berth education, and its importance for the Mom and Dad to be. Without any hesitation we joined the program, and our online classes were started, by the next day.As the whole world got shutdown, and no meet and greet were happen. But in that time through this pregnancy classes we got a opportunity to be connected with our trainer and other attendees too over online classes. Throughout this training period I was wondering about my sister and our Trainer Mrs Gayathri Suresh that how nicely she handled, explained the details easily, and understandable through her experiences and results. By god’s grace we received our baby girl and what we learned from that pregnancy training sessions were helpful to care our baby girl. So, I recommend you too to attend this wonderful class for your children."

      content : "Pregnancy is god’s precious gift that a women gets in her life and also it’s the perfect time for her to enjoy motherhood. Yes!!! I enjoyed every cycle of it and my biggest support for this to happen was our IRAIVI founder and my trainer Mrs.Gayathri Suresh. The Actual course covers major six topics (nutrition,labor&birth process,comfort measures& positions, labor coping techniques, prenatal exercise, breastfeeding, newborn care and postpartum) in 6 sessions like 2hrs a week which is so comfortable for any couple to attend that too in our convenient time and batch. All the topics were covered very well and she makes us more comfortable in learning and understanding them. We used to ask too many doubts and we got it cleared every time,not only during sessions but whenever we are bothered by anything we used to call her and get it sorted immediately. I felt this course is necessary for every pregnant women and it’ll be more effective if you attend it as a couple. Mrs.Gayathri gives us lot of tips and it works well, you can feel it post giving birth too.Yes our girl baby is 1year now and we are very happy parenting her. Really we are gifted to have this course at the right time. I would like to recommend this course to my friends and family and feel so happy for that."
